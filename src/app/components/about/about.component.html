      <h2>Project Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        AstroPartner is a web application developed as the final project for my Master’s degree in Web Development. 
        It serves both an educational and exploratory purpose showcasing modern web technologies, external APIs, and user-centered design in a real-world application.
      </p>
      <p>
        The application features lunar forecasts, a personal calendar, interaction forum, and astrology-based insights, built using Angular, a weather API for lunar data, and a custom backend that manages events, users, posts, comments, and daily horoscopes.

      <h2>Why Astrology?</h2>
      <p>
        AstroPartner was inspired by a personal interest in astrology and the moon. 
        Beyond its academic foundation, the project is a creative exploration—designed for those who enjoy cosmic themes and want practical tools built around them. 
        Developing something both functional and meaningful made the entire process even more rewarding.
